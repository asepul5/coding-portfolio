  <p> Alondra Sepulveda is an undergraduate senior art student at The University of Illinois at Chicago seeking a degree in Interdisciplinary Education in the Arts. Her creativity in the coding world comes from painting and drawing as she focuses on shapes, symmetry, and a various use of color schemes throughout her work. As a beginner in creative coding, Alondra focuses on inspirations around her environment as well as previously created sketches which she improvises on to recreate these drawings in the coding world. Overall, Alondra is looking to expand her knowledge in coding, to further create more complex images as well as possible computer games.</p>
